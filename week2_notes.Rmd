Pipeline 1 (for private use)  
- Create a repo on yoru local (i.e. your laptop)
- Create a repo on remote (GitHub)
- Connect the two with `git remote add`

Pipeline 2 (for this class)  
- A repo is already made up on GitHub
- Clone (i.e. download) the repo from remote to local
- The two (remote and local ) are already linked.
